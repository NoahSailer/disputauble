This repository contains scripts used to perform the analysis cited above, including a modified version of `CAMB` that extrapolates to negative neutrino mass. If you make use of this code please cite [Sailer, Farren, Ferraro, White (2025)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2915153). 

## Extrapolation to negative neutrino mass

The modified version of `CAMB` can be installed with

```
python3 -m pip install -v git+https://github.com/NoahSailer/disputauble --user
```

To use it in `Cobaya` include `disputauble.CobayaCAMB_mnuEff` in your `theory` block. See `defaults/camb_mnu-eff_nuDegenerate.yaml` for an example.

## Public chains and scripts

Chains are publicly available on [zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org). Download the chains and remake the figures (currently limited to figures 1 and 3) with:

```
mkdir figures
wget ... (will upload chains to zenodo shortly)
unzip chains.zip
wget https://raw.github.com/NoahSailer/disputauble/main/do_analysis.py
python do_analysis.py
```

Should you wish to rerun the chains, do so with:

```
git clone https://github.com/NoahSailer/disputauble
cd disputauble
bash do_analysis.sh --submit=true --njobs=3
```
